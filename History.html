    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Got me feeling the nostalgia
        <br>When you look at me (look at me)<br>
        <br> Thinking 'bout what could have happened
        <br> Or what could've been <br> 
        <br> Finally a face I know, ain't that a sight to see? <br> 
        <br> Take my time then take your clothes off <br> 
        <br> One more time, maybe <br> 
        <br> Actin' like you don't recall, it ain't impressin' me <br> 
        <br> Didn't come to see your friends, I know you came for me <br> 
        <br> Like your dress, but you fit better in my wrinkled tee <br> 
        <br> We moved on to newer things, but we got history <br> 
        <br> Put my feelings all aside<br>
        <br> Don't know how to make it right <br> 
        <br> Pictures poppin' on my mind <br> 
        <br> All these occasions<br>
        <br>Let's work it out with me<br>
        <br>I don't think it hurts to give another try on it<br>
        <br>Ain't nobody here know you like I do<br>
        <br>Ask all your friends if they know 'bout your size of shoes<br>
        <br>How you like to cry when you laugh, when you off the booze<br>
        <br>I moved on but I still remember a thing or two<br>
        <br>I know you said "gimme a hug", and I said "gimme a break"<br>
        <br>I wasn't trying my best, all the mistakes that I made<br>
        <br>I'm learning that it ain't the right move<br>
        <br>Learn from my mistakes, ain't that what the adults do?<br>
            ...</p>
